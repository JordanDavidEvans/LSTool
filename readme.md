# LSTool QA Explorer

This repository contains a modular Chrome extension for website QA. It crawls all internal pages of the current site, collects HTML for each page while staying on the origin, and collates the results into a local report.

## Usage
1. Load the extension in Chrome's developer mode.
2. Navigate to a site and click the extension action to start crawling.
3. After crawling, a report page opens showing a summary of header counts for each internal page.
