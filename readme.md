# LSTool QA Explorer

This repository contains a modular Chrome extension for website QA. The initial module crawls all internal pages of the current site, collects heading structure (H1-H6), and presents the results on a local report page. The report colour-codes each heading level and provides controls to adjust the colours in the preview.

## Usage
1. Load the extension in Chrome's developer mode.
2. Navigate to a site and click the extension action to start crawling.
3. After crawling, a report page opens showing all headings for each internal page.
